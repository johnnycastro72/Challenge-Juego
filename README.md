## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

What is sought in this game is to pre-construct a series of questions with 4 answer options and one of them valid, plus a category associated with the same level of difficulty. Each question must be categorized and there must be a minimum of 5 questions per category where for each round a question must be randomly drawn from that category, there must be 5 rounds in the entire game.
There must be 5 rounds in the whole game, each round awards prizes (points or money) when the player gets it right.

The accumulated prizes are within the contest but if given the case the player intends to leave the game can withdraw before answering the question, if on the contrary the player loses then would leave the game without the accumulated that would take at that time.
